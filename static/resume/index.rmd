### Coryton Refinery

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* Maximised Sour Water Stripper (SWS) sour water treatment capacity.
* Commissioned XP Steam Heater package, utilised waste XP steam on SWS reboiler.
* Refinery waste water treatment plant no bypass, full treatment of waste water positive environmental impact.
* Lowered refinery steam amin pressure, allowing electrical export ex refinery to UK grid.
* compliance with 10% chemical usage reduction initiative on FCCU.
* Utilisation of XP steam Heater package, prevfiously mothballed from initial start-up.
:::


### Ninian Central Platform

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* Screw Compressor Start-up Modifications Reduced synthetic oil losses, savings of £30,000 per month. 
:::


### Erskine Project

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* Erskine pump tripping - low suction pressure
* Phantom turbine trips - Power outage on Lomond platform and Erskine module, resulting in 20% reduction in Erskine field production.
* Erskine module metering skid sampler cup explosive decompression material failure - fix failure by recommending new sampler cup material. 
:::


### Ninan South (GB4001)

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* GB4001 compressor module - CCC vendor unable ti achieve compressor start-up and load-up. Separator pressure control setpoints adjusted to enable load-up of compressor.

:::

### Ninan Central Process Technical Authority

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* NSP compressor fouling - pull bundle recommendation and GAP vessel installation.
* Replaced NCP diesel system  after bulk tank failure. New tankage installed within 16 weeks, power turbine fouling, and wash frequency greatly reduced due to ability to drain water off diesel storage tank, eliminating interface between diesel and water at tank bottoms and eliminating bugs in diesel.
:::


### Hanze Platform

N/A

N/A

N/A

::: concise
* Produced water treatment package re-commissioning prior to start-up.  All process control valves on skid not operating - traced to valve actuator air vent corrosion, sourced and ordered plastic air vents. Stroke checked control valves to ensure correct operation.  Performance tested produced water treatment package on diesel and water mix.
*Hanze platform Crude oil stabilier - trouble shot off spec export crude oil (salt content), traced to potable water wash to crude stabiliser tower closed (as part of pot water usage reduction).  Reinstated potable water wash to Crude oil stabiliser column.  Hanze export crude oil onspec for salt after a week of continuous washing of column trays.
